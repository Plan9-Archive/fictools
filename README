Interactive fiction tools for Plan 9

A collection of ports to Plan 9 of tools for building and playing
interactive fiction files.  The "buildall" script builds and installs
the frotz and glulxe interpreters and the inform 6 programming
language and some utilities for manipulating z-machine files.  The
"buildlibc" and "buildvbcc" scripts are for a c-to-zmachine compiler.

inform: language and compiler for z machine files 
frotz: runs traditional zmachine files 
ztools: analyzes and disassembles z machine files
zrip: extracts zmachine files from zblorb archives
cheapglk: support library for glulxe
glulxe: 32-bit modern IF interpreter
vbcc: c to z machine asm compiler 
castle1.1: includes libc for vbccz
