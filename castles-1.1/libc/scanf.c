/* This scanf code was derived from my printf code, which in turn was
 * derived from Alan Cox's printk.  It was tested by [no one so far...]
 */

/* Disclaimer: I haven't even THOUGHT about testing this.  If you do decide
 * to be brave and test it, and it doesn't work, you have the following
 * options:
 *	o	Send me mail telling me it doesn't work, which I will ignore
 *		since I already knew that.
 *	o	Fix it yourself
 *	o	isolate the problem and send it to the list, and maybe
 *		I'll fix it
 */

/* BTW, the above comment may be destroyed once this has been tested.  It's
 * not nessisary for my great great grandchildren to see it when they
 * take Ancient Linux History...
 */

/* Incidentally, if it doesn't work, it may well be because I never bothered
 * to learn how to use scanf()...I briefly tried it for the usaco qualification
 * round, but had some wierd problems...ask me after mid February...BTW the
 * problems had nothing to do with scanf(); it was still broken (hopelessly)
 * when I went to getchar().
 */

/* Note, too that the current version probably assumes some things with
 * variable argument handling that it shouldn't.  Don't expect this to
 * work on a 386 in 32 bit mode, don't expect this to work on a Z80,
 * or anything other than an 8086.  In fact, don't expect it to even
 * work on an 8086 ;-)
